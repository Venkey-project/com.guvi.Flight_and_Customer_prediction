"Flight Ticket Price and Customer Satisfaction Prediction"
This project involves the two datasets of flights data and passengers data. By using this datasets have to perform data preprocessing
and exploratory data analysis and machine learning models to train the data and integrate the models in mlflow. Finally developed streamlit application 
to know the flight ticket price and coustomer satisfaction using user feedback.
Requirements: Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook, Data Preprocessing, Visual Studio Code, EDA, ML Flow ui and Streamlit

And also I attached project illustration in main file for detailed explanation.
